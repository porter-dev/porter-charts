## Info
[MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) is a cross-platform document-oriented database. Classified as a NoSQL database, MongoDB eschews the traditional table-based relational database structure in favor of JSON-like documents with dynamic schemas, making the integration of data in certain types of applications easier and faster.

## Docs 
 To use MongoDB on Porter refer to the [Porter docs](https://docs.porter.run/enterprise/deploying-addons/mongodb).
